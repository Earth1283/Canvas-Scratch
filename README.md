# Intro
Abusing scratch as a scratch noob to create a scratch drawing board that can save itself.

# Features
Features involve:
- Dynamic reading and writing of the canvas save
- (Currently) One color selection system
- Simple UI

# Known Bugs
1. The first attempt to write/draw doesn't work
2. The saved file makes the pen markings larger than they should be

# Future Features
- Infinite Canvas
- More colors
- More efficient spacial storage methods (less rows in the save code array then the 172,800 rows in the standard save code)

# Controls
[S] Shows/Hides the save array. Press the right mouse button in the editor to download or upload.
[Left Mouse Button] Hold and drag to draw around the board. Changes are saved automatically
